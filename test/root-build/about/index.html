      <h1 id="what-is-this-site">What is this Site?</h1>
<p>This is a personal page where I post online tutorials for a variety of 
software packages, record my journeys when trying to tackle difficult or
obscure programming-related problems, and document my personal projects.</p>
<p>This site is split into 3 main parts that you may care about.</p>
<h2 id="infodump">Infodump</h2>
<p>This is a place where I document the knowledge I&#39;ve accumulated from learning
and writing all manners of software, ranging from web applications to mobile apps
to 3D rendering. By keeping this information all in one place, I hope to not spend
hours on the Internet trying to remember how to configure software packages, 
relearn an API or programming language, or reviewing complex mathematical
concepts for 3D rendering. This may also serve as a nice starting point for
newer developers who have already started learning a programming language and
want to explore what applications they can make with their current knowledge or
those wanting to learn about a specific field of computer science, such as 
web development or mobile/desktop app development.</p>
<h2 id="blog">Blog</h2>
<p>This is a place where I hope to document obscure problems and record how I solved
those problems to serve both as a lesson for myself and as a solution for you
to use in your own projects. These could be simple things like troubleshooting
an Apache web server or things that took an absurdly long time to fix, such as
learning to pop back to the root of SwiftUI&#39;s navigation stack on an iOS app.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p>This is where I document the progress I&#39;ve made on my software projects and
teach others how to use my software packages. The source code for most of these
projects will be hosted on Github or another service, though if these services
somehow become unavailable, I might make the source code and binaries available 
here. All documentation for these projects, however, will be stored on this site.</p>
