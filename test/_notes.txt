Goals of DevDump infodump section:
* To provide basic overview of a topic
    - Example: For Programming Languages, each one should gives instructions on:
        * Installation
        * Compiling/Interpreting file(s)
        * Basic Features (Variables, Functions, Classes, Memory Management)
        * Importing/Exporting Packages and Modules(like in python, ruby, javascript)
        * Weird Quirks
        * Sample Applications


Goals of Project section:
* Keep track of how project works
* Draft documentation for the website before making it public.

Tutorials:

One collection that is needed is the tutorial collection, which is list of tutorials which describe how to recreate and solve certain problems. 
These will only have ONE tag in order to isolate a problem. 
They will have the directory format /tutorials/:TAG/:NAME.
Tutorials that require more than one page will have the directory /tutorials/:TAG/:NAME/subpages.all
